Project Title
Engineer 1P13: Integrated Cornerstone Design Projects in Engineering - Healthcare Challenge

Introduction
This is a project that was completed as part of the Engineer 1P13: Integrated Cornerstone Design Projects in Engineering course. The project was a healthcare-focused challenge where the team was tasked with finding a solution to a real-world problem. The challenge was divided into two teams; one team was responsible for creating a container that could facilitate the sterilization of a surgical tool, while the other team was tasked with writing a computer program that could control a robotic q-arm via muscle sensors.

Learning Components
The main learning components of this project were to:

Understand and utilize the engineering design process
Make informed decisions in creating a sterilization container based on our design goals and given surgical tool and container footprint
Create easily understandable python codes
Conduct informed research and create citations in IEEE format
Work together as a team in a real-life engineering environment
Favorite Parts
My favorite parts of this project were:

Controlling a real robotic q-arm and programming it to complete specific tasks
Becoming familiar with the q-labs environment and the raspberry pi
Researching the biomaterials associated with hip implants
Skills Developed
The skills that I developed during this project were:

Proficiency in coding Python
Knowledge about biomaterials
Scholarly research skills
IEEE citation skills
Conclusion
Overall, Project 2 was an introduction into how multiple projects can contribute to a singular solution, and the skills that I developed are crucial to my development in the McMaster Engineering program. I look forward to my future projects in this course and working with different problems and solutions.
